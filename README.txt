Introduction
------------
This game is a partial implementation of the tabletop game Necromunda created by Games Workshop. The parts currently implemented are movement and shooting. Close-combat, recovery and campaign related stuff is missing.

Start
-----
To start the game simply double-click on the provided JAR file.

You must have at least the Java 6 JRE installed.

Controls
--------
The game can be controlled as follows:

Left mouse button:		Select model, end movement, shoot
Right mouse button:		Abort movement
W, A, S, D:				Move camera
B:						Attempt to break a web pistol web
M:						Start regular movement
R:						Start run movement
C:						Climb a ladder (during regular movement; press repeatedly to cycle through ladders if more than one is in reach)
Y:						Cycle weapons
O:						Cycle weapon mode
H:						Start shooting
N:						Cycle to next phase
E:						End current turn

Note: When climbing you first have to start a movement. If you are standing close enough to a ladder you can press 'C'. After this you have to stop the movement first by clicking the left mouse button. If you have not yet moved all of the allowed distance you can continue moving by pressing 'M' again.
